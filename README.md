# About Me! 👋 #

Hello, my name is Jimmy Silva, and here is some information about me! 😁 <br><br> 
My current interests are in cybersecurity, information technology, computer science, networking, and system administration. 💯<br>
I am an undergraduate sophomore attending the Honors College at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 👑<br>
You can reach out to me on github, or preferably, my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmy-silva-njit-adhc/ ⚪<br>
I'm currently working on a variety of class projects in JavaScript, Java, PHP, HTML, MySQL, and Python. <br>
In my spare time, I enjoy participating in CTFs—my favorite challenges are in forensics and networking!  🔓 <br>

Just picked up my Comptia Security+ Certification in December!<br><br>
